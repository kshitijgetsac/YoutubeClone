# YoutubeClone

A frontend clone built using React and Tailwind.It is a way of learning for me so feel free to drop in and suggest something because it can be a learning experience for me
High Level of what I think Youtube has
-A search bar
-A lot of cards which shows the current feed
-A sign in button(this project will be less on backend side and I am mostly curious to learn frontend so I'll focus on that first)
-A hamburger button(Don't know if will be able to implement that).
-When a user clicks on a video a huge landing page renders and there are a bunch of titles on the side as well(Will try to do this as well).
